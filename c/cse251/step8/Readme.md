# To-do

## Final Tasks

Some final tasks to do and this program will be done:

1. Have your program ignore words that are zero length. This happens if you type two spaces in a row. That will take just one simple test.

2. Have your program print the average word length.

3. Have your program print the longest word entered.

To do the last part, you will need to create another array and save the word into it. You can save the word into it by simply copying the characters over into it. Remember, len is how long the word is so far.

Enter this line of text as a test case:

```text
The comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky
but could never parallel the challenge of an acquisition in the
here and now.
```
