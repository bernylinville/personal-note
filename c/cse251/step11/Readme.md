1. Add a command:  fire.  When the fire command is selected, you fire your arrow. It travels up to 3 rooms in the direction you are looking. If it enters the room with the Wumpus, the Wumpus is killed. Set the room value to Empty to indicate he is gone. This should not take much code to get working.

You need to also add the ability for DisplayStatus to detect that we have won.
