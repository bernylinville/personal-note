# pointers

A pointer is just the address of a piece of data in memory.

1. Instead of passing around a whole copy of the data, you can just pass a pointer.
2. You might want two pieces of code to work on the same piece of data rather than a separate copy.

Pointers help you do both these things: avoid copies and share data.
